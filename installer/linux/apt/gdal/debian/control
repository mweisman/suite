Description: The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)
 The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a unifying C/C++ API for 
 accessing raster geospatial data, and currently includes formats like 
 GeoTIFF, Erdas Imagine, Arc/Info Binary, CEOS, DTED, GXF, and SDTS. It is 
 intended to provide efficient access, suitable for use in viewer 
 applications, and also attempts to preserve coordinate systems and 
 metadata.
