Installing the OpenGeo Suite for Linux
======================================

This section describes how to install the OpenGeo Suite for Linux.  

There are two Editions of the OpenGeo Suite: `Community Edition <http://opengeo.org/technology/suite/>`_ and `Enterprise Edition <http://opengeo.org/products/suite/>`_.  Each Edition is available for CentOS and Ubuntu systems.  Please see the appropriate section below that matches your system.

In addition, instructions are available for installing GeoServer or PostGIS as standalone packages, instead of installing the entire OpenGeo Suite.
