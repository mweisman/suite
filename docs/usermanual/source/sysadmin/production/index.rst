Running the OpenGeo Suite in Production
=======================================

The quality of an OpenGeo Suite deployment in a production environment is measured by three criteria:

* :ref:`sysadmin.production.reliability`: the server's ability to successfully fulfill requests for maps and data.
* :ref:`sysadmin.production.availability`: the overall uptime of the server (including both planned and unplanned outages).
* :ref:`sysadmin.production.performance`: how quickly the server can fulfill client requests.

This section presents various techniques for tuning the OpenGeo Suite to improve the reliability, availability, and performance of production instances.
