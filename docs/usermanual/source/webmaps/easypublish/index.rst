Basic Workflow for Creating a Web Map
=====================================

This section will guide you through the process of creating a basic web map -- from loading data to a finished map.  For the purposes of this workflow, we will assume that your initial data is stored as shapefiles, although there are many types of data formats that the OpenGeo Suite can load.

We will use GeoExplorer as the framework for creating your map.
