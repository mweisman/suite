Application development with the Client SDK
===========================================

This tutorial will discuss how to create an application using the OpenGeo Suite Client SDK.

The full API documentation for the OpenGeo Suite Client SDK is available at http://suite.opengeo.org/opengeo-docs/sdk-api/,  and is included with this documentation bundle.

For more information on the :file:`suite-sdk` script itself, used throughout this tutorial for creating and testing applications, please see the section on :ref:`apps.sdk.client.script`.

The Client SDK is usually bundled with the OpenGeo Suite (under the :file:`sdk` subdirectory), but is available separately from http://opengeo.org/technology/sdk/ .
