Analytics
=========

OpenGeo Suite Analytics allows server administrators to view performance metrics and server statistics graphically. Integrated with the GeoServer web administration interface, Analytics analyzes and aggregates the requests to GeoServer and displays them on easy-to-understand tables, graphs, and integrated maps. 

With Analytics, an administrator can:

* Visualize the number of requests processed, sorted by service
* View traffic geographically and by IP address
* View commonly requested resources
* View successful and unsuccessful requests
* Filter requests by date/time
* Track individual requests with a unique identifier
* Show performance metrics, including average request time, average throughput, and request size

Analytics is only available with the Enterprise Edition of the OpenGeo Suite.
